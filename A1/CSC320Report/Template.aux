\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {5}{\ignorespaces These were generated by tuning the epsilon parameter to stop the gradient descent early. Learning rate values of $10^{-4}, 10^{-5}, 10^{-6}$ , gave 688, 243, and 1 iterations for gradient descent respectively. The images are in that order from left to right. In these runs, $\epsilon $ was kept constant at 1 x$10^{-4}$ The longer the algorithm runs, the more different the visualization of theta looks from an image. This is done on a dataset of 4, with 2 images of Carell and Baldwin each.\relax }}{6}}
