To run the code for parts 2 to 6, run the folling script

python3 digits.py

This just calls the three needed scripts.To see what each of the three scripts are doing individually, you can check the following notebooks

BeginningPart.ipynb # contains code for parts 2 to 6
MomemtumContours.ipynb # this is part 5
PlotContours.ipynb # this is part 6
digits.py is written using python3, and the other code for later parts is in python2.


To run part 8, type "python faces.py" into terminal. This file is written in Python 2.

Expected output: Graph of learning curve as shown in report. Also prints the Training Set, Test Set and Validation Set accuracies at every 100 iterations. 


To run part 9, type "python part9.py" into terminal. This file is written in Python 2.

Expected output: Figures of weight visualizations betweeen input and hidden layer. 

To run part 10, type "python deepfaces.py" into terminal. This file is written in Python 2.

Expected output: Graph of learning curve as shown in report. Also prints the Training Set, Test Set and Validation Set accuracies at every 100 iterations
